and to log them out.

then the views.py is for those who are logged in

via get and post methodes, and to redirect them to the homepage when needed.

Models.py is created to store all of the data that is needed, users id
notes, events created, emails, password, id, usernames.
 init is created to generate a hash dor securing the passwords the usr is using, so when your looking at the layout the user's information is kept safe'
